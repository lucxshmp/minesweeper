# minesweeper
I delivered this project during my first semester of college for my programming class. It was a little bit challenging since I had never worked with software development at the time, but I'm pretty proud of how it turned out. 
Basically, it reads the size of a Minesweeper board, the locations of the bombs, and the places where you want to make your moves from a file. Then, it prints out the board and the final result of the game.
